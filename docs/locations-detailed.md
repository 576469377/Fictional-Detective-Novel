**Metro System Relevance:**
- Several key locations have direct subway access
- Tunnel systems potentially exploited for covert movement
- Historical precedent for underground development in area

**Surface Transportation:**
- Major investigation sites located on historical streetcar routes
- Modern traffic patterns follow 19th-century development corridors
- Emergency services access carefully considered in site selection

### Historical Urban Development
**1847 City Planning:**
- Original sites chosen during period of major urban expansion
