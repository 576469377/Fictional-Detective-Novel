## Primary Locations

### Metropolitan Police Headquarters
**Address:** 1247 Federal Avenue, Downtown District  
**Description:** A imposing brick and granite building from the 1960s, twelve stories of bureaucratic efficiency with a facade that has witnessed decades of the city's criminal history. The building sits on a corner lot, with Federal Avenue running north-south and 12th Street providing eastern access.

**Notable Features:**
- **Detective Bureau (8th Floor):** Open floor plan with individual desk clusters, fluorescent lighting that casts everything in clinical white. Sarah's corner office has windows facing both Federal Avenue and 12th Street, providing views of the financial district's glass towers.
- **Evidence Room (Basement Level 2):** Climate-controlled storage with rows of metal shelving containing decades of unsolved cases. The air always smells faintly of dust and old paper.
- **Captain Morrison's Office (8th Floor, Corner):** Glass-walled office with views of the city center, filled with commendation plaques, family photos, and three decades of police procedural manuals.

**Atmospheric Details:**
- Morning sunlight streams through east-facing windows, creating long shadows across the detective desks
- The elevators always take longer than expected, with brass indicator lights that stick between floors
- Coffee from the break room tastes perpetually burnt, but everyone drinks it anyway
- Security cameras in every hallway, but the footage quality is grainy and the monitors flicker

### The Arts District - Emma's Neighborhood  
**Location:** Eastern quadrant of the city, formerly industrial zone converted to artist studios and galleries

**Emma's Loft Building:**
- **Address:** The Meridian Complex, 847 Industrial Way
- **Building Description:** Converted textile factory from the 1920s, red brick with large industrial windows. Five stories with exposed iron fire escapes creating geometric shadows on the brick facade.
- **Emma's Unit (4th Floor):** 1,200 square feet of open space with 14-foot ceilings, exposed brick walls, and massive windows facing west toward the city center. Hardwood floors worn smooth by decades of factory workers, now covered with colorful rugs and art supplies.

**Neighborhood Character:**
- **Morning Atmosphere:** Quiet streets with delivery trucks bringing supplies to galleries and studios. Coffee shops that serve artists and museum workers, filled with sketches taped to walls and the sound of espresso machines.
- **Evening Atmosphere:** Gallery openings, food trucks, street musicians. Warm light spilling from studio windows, silhouettes of artists working late into the night.

### Industrial District - The Warehouse Locations

#### Morrison Textiles Warehouse (Primary Crime Scene)
**Address:** 2847 Warehouse Row, Industrial District  
**History:** Built in 1913 for textile manufacturing, abandoned in 1987 when the company moved operations overseas. Five-story brick building with loading docks on the ground level.

**Physical Description:**
- **Exterior:** Red brick facade with steel-framed windows, many broken or boarded up. Graffiti covers the lower levels, but it's old and faded. Iron fire escapes create intricate shadows against the brick.
- **Interior Spaces:**
  - **Ground Floor:** Concrete floors with oil stains and scattered debris. Loading dock doors that stick and creak when opened. Pigeons nest in the rafters, and their calls echo through the empty space.
  - **Upper Floors:** Open floor plan with support columns every twenty feet. Wooden floors warped by years of weather infiltration. Excellent acoustics—footsteps and voices carry clearly through the empty spaces.

**Atmospheric Elements:**
- During rain, water drips through damaged roof sections, creating puddles that reflect the weak light from broken windows
- Industrial heating pipes run along the ceilings, occasionally settling with metallic groans
- Dust motes dance in columns of light from the high windows
- The building retains the faint smell of machine oil and fabric dye even decades after closure

#### Underground Tunnels (Society's Hidden Network)
**Location:** Beneath the Financial District, connecting major buildings through service tunnels built in the 1940s

**Physical Description:**
- **Main Tunnel:** Eight-foot-high concrete corridor with fluorescent lighting every thirty feet. Electrical conduits and water pipes run along the ceiling. The air is consistently cool and slightly humid.
- **Communication Hub:** Converted maintenance room fitted with modern computer equipment and temporal communication devices. The contrast between the aging concrete and cutting-edge technology creates an unsettling atmosphere.
- **Hidden Entrances:** Accessed through maintenance areas in participating buildings, disguised behind utility panels and false walls.

### Metropolitan Museum - Professional Environment
**Location:** Museum District, 1200 Cultural Avenue

**Emma's Work Area - Exhibit Preparation Department:**
- **Location:** Third floor, north wing
- **Description:** Long hallway lined with preparation rooms, each equipped with specialized lighting for examining historical artifacts. The rooms smell of conservation chemicals and old paper.
- **Emma's Workstation:** Corner room with north-facing windows providing consistent natural light. Worktables covered with archival materials, color-matching equipment, and historical reference books.

**Atmospheric Details:**
- Footsteps echo down marble hallways lined with historical exhibits
- Climate control maintains precise temperature and humidity, creating a slight background hum
- Security guards patrol in soft-soled shoes, their presence felt but rarely seen
- The building retains the reverent quiet of a space dedicated to preserving history

### State University - Academic Setting
**Location:** University District, sprawling campus with buildings from multiple architectural periods

**Professor Vasquez's Office (History Department):**
- **Building:** Humanities Hall, built in 1965, red brick with narrow windows
- **Office Description:** Third floor corner office filled with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, multiple desk areas covered with research papers, and comfortable reading chairs positioned near windows overlooking the central quad.

**Department Atmosphere:**
- Hallways lined with faculty office doors, most decorated with cartoons, academic conference posters, and sign-up sheets for office hours
- The elevator is ancient and slow, so most people use the stairs, creating constant foot traffic and conversation
- Coffee pot in the department lounge is perpetually brewing; professors gather there between classes to discuss research and departmental politics

### Temporal Communication Facility (Final Chapters)
**Location:** Geneva, Switzerland (International Setting)

**Facility Description:**
- **Architecture:** Modern glass and steel construction with sustainable design elements, representing international cooperation and future-focused thinking
- **Interior:** Open floor plan with quantum computing equipment, temporal receivers, and collaboration spaces designed for international teams
- **Sarah's Office:** Glass-walled space overlooking the main communication center, furnished with advanced detection equipment and security systems
